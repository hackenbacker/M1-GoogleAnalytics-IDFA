# Description
I met the following error when building an App with GoogleAnalytics and GoogleIDFASupport on M1 mac.
```
ðŸ”´ In (...)/Pods/GooglelDFASupport/Libraries/libAdldAccessLibrary.a(TAGActualAddAccess.o),
building for iOS Simulator, 
but linking in object file built for iOS, 
file '(...)/Pods/GooglelDFASupport/Libraries/libAdIdAccessLibrary.a' 
for architecture arm64
ðŸ”´ Linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```

 I solved the problem by changing the version of `GoogleIDFASupport` to `3.12.0`. (see `Podfile`)

 This repository is the minimum configuration for GoogleAnalytics and GoogleIDFASupport to be built on Apple Silicon machines.

pod install
